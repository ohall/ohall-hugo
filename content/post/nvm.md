NVM is the Node Version Manager, a bash script you can and should use to manage multiple NodeJS versions.  As a Node developer, you'll invariably find yourself dealing with Node version compatibility issues forcing you to switch versions of Node depending on what you're working on.  It would be nice if Node offered a command like `use 4.1.1`, well NVM does just that.

First install it:

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.27.1/install.sh | bash
```
