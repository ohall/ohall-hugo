Building a Go Bag

December 5, 2012
Taking after my grandmother, I have a tendency to imagine worst (or bad anyway) case scenarios.  On of those is having to flee our apartment on short notice and evacuate.  To this end, I keep two "go bags" on standby.  One for me and one for my fiancee.  Both are sturdy, comfortable packs, loaded with a few items to make a midnight escape from manhattan a little less desperate. Here's what I pack:

A pack:

$100 cash A spare house key A thumb drive with some important documents on it. Light Sticks, Sunglasses, Compass

Water, 40oz of peanut butter, 2400 calorie bar, salt, pepper, sugar, foil

First Aid kit.

Fire kit.  The jar contains some cotton balls soaked in petroleum jelly.  The steel wool allows you to start a fire with a battery. 


Plastic sheeting 9x12 Zip ties Poncho Garbage bags Latex gloves Surgical masks N95 masks Ski goggles Potassium iodide Razor blades.

Radio.

Basic Tool kit

Toilet paper, Hygiene kit, Space blanket

Maps, Important documents, Pad and pens.


Poncho Boonie hat Wool cap Towel Sweater Henly pants 2 t shirts boxers 2 pair socks

Gloves, Flashlight, Fillet knife, 2 multitools, Fire steel, Whistle.

Cordage, Duct tape, 2.5 gallon, water bag.
