When I first started my journey as a professional software developer, I got hired to work on an application in a dying language on a platform that would soon be reviled the world over.  It was a perfect place to start.

The first real project I worked on was a Flash application written in ActionScript 3, using the Flex framework. To be fair, this was cutting edge stuff at the time and seemed like it had a future. The was before Steve Jobs and 0 day exploits crapped in the punch bowl, but that's another conversation.  

The point is I started learning my craft using a language that I'd probably never see again.  Looking back it was probably among the worst I could choose, __but that never mattered__.

An aspiring programmer fretting about what language to develop in is like a carpenter worrying about what wood to work in.  It's one of many choices to be made about a project, but it does not define the carpenter's expertise.  

What matters is not the material you work in, but the tools, the craft, and the mindset you develop.

## The Tools

### Version control
Understand [version control]().  [Git]() is the most popular at the moment and seems to have a firm hold on the space.  Use GitHub.  Branch, tag, do pull requests, even if the are just against your own code, for the time being.  You can version control any files. Use git for papers, blog posts, any document that you'll want to have a record of changes to, over time.

### Text editor
Pick something and become a power user.  I personally feel most at home in an IDE, so I spend most of my time writing JavaScript in [Webstorm]().  I've created many custom templates that autocomplete common code snippets.  I know many keyboard shortcuts and tricks to simplify and expedite my workflow.  It's the equivalent of sitting in the driver's seat of a car and adjusting the mirrors and familiarizing yourself with the controls. I try to learn a little something new every day.  Some devs reccommend working without a mouse one day a week.  I haven't had the nerve for that one yet. 

### The terminal
This is among the most important skills you'll need as a developer. This will come up over and over and over. Get comfortable navigating the files system in the terminal, running applications, viewing and changing permissions, piping data from one app to another.
